# Kotlin Native base

A basic skeleton for starting a Kotlin Native multi-platform project.

At the moment, this was just me playing around a bit in some spare time.

## Usage

```
# Linux
./gradlew linuxBinaries
./build/bin/linux/releaseExecutable/kotlin-native-base

# MacOs
./gradlew macosBinaries
./build/bin/macos/releaseExecutable/kotlin-native-base.kexe
```
